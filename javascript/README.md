# Running the Scene

Simply open the `PicnicScene.html` file in a web browser.

This can be achieved by pasting the following into your browser, replacing `<PROJECT PATH>` with the absolute filepath on your machine to this project:

`file://<PROJECT PATH>/graphics-project-1/javascript/PicnicScene.html`

## Note about resolution:

The viewport will be 1600 pixels by 1000 pixels. A 1080p monitor should be able to display the application, but the browser may need to be put in fullscreen mode. You can also zoom out depending on your browser's functionality.
