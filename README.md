# graphics-project-1

This code is all three scenes for Programming Project 1: Picnic Time, done by Matthew Merritt, Michael Merritt, and Harsh Gandhi. 

The code is divided into three directories, with the following breakdown:

- `/java/` - Contains the animated 2D scene done using the Java Graphics2D package.
- `/javascript/` - Contains the animated 2D scene done using the Javascript HTML Canvas.
- `/svg/` - Contains the 2D scene done using the SVG language.

In each directory, there is a README file explaining how to run the code to generate the scene.
